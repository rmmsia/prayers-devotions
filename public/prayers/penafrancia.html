    Peñafrancia</h1>
    <p>In the 1400s, Simón Vela, who came from a rich family, gave up
    his inheritance to become a laybrother of a Franciscan convent in
    Paris. He journeyed to the mountains of Peña de Francia (“Rock of
    France”) in Salamanca, after hearing a voice instructing him to look
    for a sacred image of Mary. The statue was rediscovered in 1434 on
    the mountain.</p>
    <p>Miracles have been attributed to the image. Our Lady of
    Peñafrancia is the patroness of the Bicol Region of the Philippines.
    She is also the patroness of the city of Naga, the province of
    Camarines Sur, and the Diocese of Caceres. She is also considered
    the patroness of seafarers, farmers, and fishermen.</p>
    <h2 id="prayer">Prayer</h2>
    <p>Turn to me thine eyes, oh most loving Virgin of Peñafrancia, and
    have mercy on my soul that comes to thee, full of repentance.
    Protect my family, relatives, friends and benefactors. Intercede for
    your devotees, both the living and the dead, espeically for those
    whom I am most obliged to help.</p>
    <p>Pray for me, console me, and save me in my hours of peril,
    adversity and afflications. Above all, at the hour of my death,
    appear before your Divine Son to help and defend me. Tell Him that I
    am your devotee, that having complete trust in your protection I
    kneel before your miraculous image to ask for your powerful
    intercession.</p>
    <p>Virgin of Peñafrancia, pray for me, help me, console me, and
    deliver me from all evil.</p>
    <p>Amen.</p>

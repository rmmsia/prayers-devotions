    <p>Adapted from <a
    href="https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/devotions/novena-to-the-holy-spirit-for-the-seven-gifts-309">EWTN</a></p>
    <h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
    <p>The novena in honor of the Holy Spirit is the oldest of all
    novenas since it was first made at the direction of Our Lord Himself
    when He sent His apostles back to Jerusalem to await the coming of
    the Holy Spirit on the first Pentecost. It is still the only novena
    officially prescribed by the Church. Addressed to the Third Person
    of the Blessed Trinity, it is a powerful plea for the light and
    strength and love so sorely needed by every Christian.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, this Novena begins on the day after the Solemnity
    of the Ascension, Friday of the 6th Week of Easter, even if the
    Solemnity of the Ascension is transferred to the 7th Sunday.</p>
    <h3 id="the-seven-gifts-of-the-holy-spirit">The Seven Gifts of the
    Holy Spirit</h3>
    <p>According to Catholic Tradition, the seven gifts, as per
    St. Thomas Aquinas’ <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> — the ability to rightly judge and
    direct human affairs according to divine truth</li>
    <li><strong>Understanding</strong> — the ability to understand the
    Word of God and church teaching</li>
    <li><strong>Counsel</strong> — allows a man to be directed by God in
    matters necessary for his salvation</li>
    <li><strong>Fortitude</strong> — a firmness of mind in doing good
    and in avoiding evil, particularly when it is difficult or dangerous
    to do so, and the confidence to overcome all obstacles, even deadly
    ones, by virtue of the assurance of everlasting life</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> — the ability to judge correctly
    about matters of faith and right action, so as to never wander from
    the straight path of justice</li>
    <li><strong>Piety</strong> — revering God with filial affection,
    paying worship and duty to God, paying due duty to all men on
    account of their relationship to God, and honoring the saints and
    not contradicting Scripture</li>
    <li><strong>Fear of the Lord</strong> — we revere God and avoid
    separating ourselves from him (or, awe of Him)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="the-holy-spirit">The Holy Spirit</h3>
    <p>Only one thing is important – eternal salvation. Only one thing,
    therefore, is to be feared–sin! Sin is the result of ignorance,
    weakness, and indifference. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Light,
    of Strength, and of Love. With His sevenfold gifts He enlightens the
    mind, strengthens the will, and inflames the heart with love of God.
    To ensure our salvation we ought to invoke the Divine Spirit daily,
    for ‘The Spirit helpeth our infirmity. We know not what we should
    pray for as we ought. But the Spirit Himself asketh for us.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Almighty and eternal God, Who hast vouchsafed to regenerate us by
    water and the Holy Spirit, and hast given us forgiveness of all
    sins, vouchsafe to send forth from heaven upon us your sevenfold
    Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of
    Counsel and Fortitude, the Spirit of Knowledge and Piety, and fill
    us with the Spirit of Holy Fear. Amen.</p>
    <ul>

    <li>Hail Mary</li>

    <p>Come. Father of the poor. Come, treasures which endure; Come,
    Light of all that live!</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-fear">The Gift of Fear</h3>
    <p>The gift of Fear fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and
    makes us dread nothing so much as to offend Him by sin. It is a fear
    that arises, not from the thought of hell, but from sentiments of
    reverence and filial submission to our heavenly Father. It is the
    fear that is the beginning of wisdom, detaching us from worldly
    pleasures that could in any way separate us from God. ‘They that
    fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and in His sight will
    sanctify their souls.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-1">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O blessed Spirit of Holy Fear, penetrate my inmost heart,
    that I may set you, my Lord and God, before my face forever, help me
    to shun all things that can offend You, and make me worthy to appear
    before the pure eyes of Your Divine Majesty in heaven, where You
    live and reign in the unity of the ever Blessed Trinity, God world
    without end. Amen.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Our Father</li>
    <li>Hail Mary</li>

    <div class="day-content">
    <p>Thou, of all consolers best, Visiting the troubled breast, Dost
    refreshing peace bestow.</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-piety">The Gift of Piety</h3>
    <p>The gift of Piety begets in our hearts a filial affection for God
    as our most loving Father. It inspires us to love and respect for
    His sake persons and things consecrated to Him, as well as those who
    are vested with His authority, His Blessed Mother and the Saints,
    the Church and its visible Head, our parents and superiors, our
    country and its rulers. He who is filled with the gift of Piety
    finds the practice of his religion, not a burdensome duty, but a
    delightful service. Where there is love, there is no labor.</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-2">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Piety, possess my heart. Enkindle
    therein such a love for God, that I may find satisfaction only in
    His service, and for His sake lovingly submit to all legitimate
    authority. Amen.</p>
    <ul>

    <p>Thou in toil art comfort sweet, Pleasant coolness in the heat,
    solace in the midst of woe.</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-fortitude">The Gift of Fortitude</h3>
    <p>The Gift of Fortitude By the gift of Fortitude the soul is
    strengthened against natural fear, and supported to the end in the
    performance of duty. Fortitude imparts to the will an impulse and
    energy which move it to under take without hesitancy the most
    arduous tasks, to face dangers, to trample under foot human respect,
    and to endure without complaint the slow martyrdom of even lifelong
    tribulation. ‘He that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be
    saved.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-3">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Fortitude, uphold my soul in time of
    trouble and adversity, sustain my efforts after holiness, strengthen
    my weakness, give me courage against all the assaults of my enemies,
    that I may never be overcome and separated from Thee, my God and
    greatest Good. Amen.</p>

    <p>Light immortal! Light Divine! Visit Thou these hearts of Thine,
    And our inmost being fill!</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-knowledge">The Gift of Knowledge</h3>
    <p>The gift of Knowledge enables the soul to evaluate created things
    at their true worth–in their relation to God. Knowledge unmasks the
    pretense of creatures, reveals their emptiness, and points out their
    only true purpose as instruments in the service of God. It shows us
    the loving care of God even in adversity, and directs us to glorify
    Him in every circumstance of life. Guided by its light, we put first
    things first, and prize the friendship of God beyond all else.
    ‘Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-4">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Blessed Spirit of Knowledge, and grant that I may
    perceive the will of the Father; show me the nothingness of earthly
    things, that I may realize their vanity and use them only for Thy
    glory and my own salvation, looking ever beyond them to Thee, and
    Thy eternal rewards. Amen.</p>

    <p>If Thou take Thy grace away, nothing pure in man will stay, All
    his good is turn’d to ill.</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-understanding">The Gift of Understanding</h3>
    <p>Understanding, as a gift of the Holy Spirit, helps us to grasp
    the meaning of the truths of our holy religion BY faith we know
    them, but by Understanding we learn to appreciate and relish them.
    It enables us to penetrate the inner meaning of revealed truths and
    through them to be quickened to newness of life. Our faith ceases to
    be sterile and inactive, but inspires a mode of life that bears
    eloquent testimony to the faith that is in us; we begin to ‘walk
    worthy of God in all things pleasing, and increasing in the
    knowledge of God.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-5">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Spirit of Understanding, and enlighten our minds, that we
    may know and believe all the mysteries of salvation; and may merit
    at last to see the eternal light in Thy Light; and in the light of
    glory to have a clear vision of Thee and the Father and the Son.
    Amen.</p>

    <p>Heal our wounds–our strength renew; On our dryness pour Thy dew,
    Wash the stains of guilt away.</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-counsel">The Gift of Counsel</h3>
    <p>The gift of Counsel endows the soul with supernatural prudence,
    enabling it to judge promptly and rightly what must done, especially
    in difficult circumstances. Counsel applies the principles furnished
    by Knowledge and Understanding to the innumerable concrete cases
    that confront us in the course of our daily duty as parents,
    teachers, public servants, and Christian citizens. Counsel is
    supernatural common sense, a priceless treasure in the quest of
    salvation. ‘Above all these things, pray to the Most High, that He
    may direct thy way in truth.’</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-6">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Spirit of Counsel, help and guide me in all my ways, that
    I may always do Thy holy will. Incline my heart to that which is
    good; turn it away from all that is evil, and direct me by the
    straight path of Thy commandments to that goal of eternal life for
    which I long.</p>

    <p>Bend the stubborn heart and will, melt the frozen warm the chill.
    Guide the steps that go astray!</p>
    <h3 id="the-gift-of-wisdom">The Gift of Wisdom</h3>
    <p>Embodying all the other gifts, as charity embraces all the other
    virtues, Wisdom is the most perfect of the gifts. Of wisdom it is
    written ‘all good things came to me with her, and innumerable riches
    through her hands.’ It is the gift of Wisdom that strengthens our
    faith, fortifies hope, perfects charity, and promotes the practice
    of virtue in the highest degree. Wisdom enlightens the mind to
    discern and relish things divine, in the appreciation of which
    earthly joys lose their savor, whilst the Cross of Christ yields a
    divine sweetness according to the words of the Saviour: ’Take up thy
    cross and follow me, for my yoke is sweet and my burden light.</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-7">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Spirit of Wisdom, and reveal to my soul the mysteries of
    heavenly things, their exceeding greatness, power and beauty. Teach
    me to love them above and beyond all the passing joys and
    satisfactions of earth. Help me to attain them and possess them for
    ever. Amen.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Our Father</li>

    <div class="day-content">
    <p>Thou, on those who evermore Thee confess and Thee Adore, in Thy
    sevenfold gift, Descend; Give Them Comfort when they die; Give them
    Life with Thee on high; Give them joys which never end. Amen.</p>
    <h3 id="the-fruits-of-the-holy-spirit">The Fruits of the Holy
    Spirit</h3>
    <p>The gifts of the Holy Spirit perfect the supernatural virtues by
    enabling us to practice them with greater docility to divine
    inspiration. As we grow in the knowledge and love of God under the
    direction of the Holy Spirit, our service becomes more sincere and
    generous, the practice of virtue more perfect. Such acts of virtue
    leave the heart filled with joy and consolation and are known as
    Fruits of the Holy Spirit. These Fruits in turn render the practice
    of virtue more attractive and become a powerful incentive for still
    greater efforts in the service of God, to serve Whom is to
    reign.</p>
    <h3 id="prayer-8">Prayer</h3>
    <p>Come, O Divine Spirit, fill my heart with Thy heavenly fruits,
    Thy charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, faith,
    mildness, and temperance, that I may never weary in the service of
    God, but by continued faithful submission to Thy inspiration may
    merit to be united eternally with Thee in the love of the Father and
    the Son. Amen.</p>

    <h3>Consecration to the Holy Spirit</h3>
    <p>
      On my knees before the great multitude of heavenly witnesses,
      I offer myself, soul and body to You, Eternal Spirit of God.
      I adore the brightness of Your purity, the unerring keenness of
      Your justice, and the might of Your love. You are the Strength
      and Light of my soul. In You I live and move and am. I desire
      never to grieve You by unfaithfulness to grace and I pray with all my heart to be kept from the smallest sin against You. Mercifully guard my every thought and grant that I may always watch for Your light, and listen to Your voice,
      and follow Your gracious inspirations. I cling to You and give
      myself to You and ask You, by Your compassion to watch over me
      in my weakness. Holding the pierced Feet of Jesus and looking at
      His Five Wounds, and trusting in His Precious Blood and adoring His
      opened Side and stricken Heart, I implore You, Adorable Spirit,
      Helper of my infirmity, to keep me in Your grace that I may never
      sin against You. Give me grace, O Holy Spirit, Spirit of the
      Father and the Son to say to You always and everywhere,
      'Speak Lord for Your servant heareth.' Amen.

      <h3>Prayer for the 7 Gifts</h3>
      <p>
        O Lord Jesus Christ, Who, before ascending into heaven, did
        promise to send the Holy Spirit to finish Your work in the souls
        of Your Apostles and Disciples, deign to grant the same Holy Spirit
        to me that He may perfect in my soul, the work of Your grace and
        Your love. Grant me the Spirit of Wisdom that I may despise the
        perishable things of this world and aspire only after the things
        that are eternal, the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten my mind
        with the light of Your divine truth, the Spirit of Counsel that
        I may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God and gaining
        heaven, the Spirit of Fortitude that I may bear my cross with
        You and that I may overcome with courage all the obstacles that
        oppose my salvation, the Spirit of Knowledge that I may know God
        and know myself and grow perfect in the science of the Saints,
        the Spirit of Piety that I may find the service of God sweet
        and amiable, and the Spirit of Fear that I may be filled with
        a loving reverence towards God and may dread in any way to
        displease Him. Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Your
        true disciples and animate me in all things with Your Spirit.

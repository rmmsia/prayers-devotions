    <p>O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended you. I detest
    all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of
    Hell. But most of all, because I offended you, my God, who are all
    good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help
    of your grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my
    life. Amen.</p>

    <p>Dearest Holy Mother, Most Holy Mary, you undo the knots that
    suffocate your children, extend your merciful hands to me. I entrust
    to You today this knot….and all the negative consequences that it
    provokes in my life. I give you this knot that torments me and makes
    me unhappy and so impedes me from uniting myself to You and Your Son
    Jesus, my Savior.I run to You, Mary, Undoer of Knots because I trust
    you and I know that you never despise a sinning child who comes to
    ask you for help. I believe that you can undo this knot because
    Jesus grants you everything. I believe that you want to undo this
    knot because you are my Mother. I believe that You will do this
    because you love me with eternal love.</p>
    <p>Thank you, Dear Mother.</p>
    <p>Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me.</p>
    <p>The one who seeks grace, finds it in Mary’s hands.</p>

    <p>Mary, Beloved Mother, channel of all grace, I return to You today
    my heart, recognizing that I am a sinner in need of your help. Many
    times I lose the graces you grant me because of my sins of egoism,
    pride, rancor and my lack of generosity and humility. I turn to You
    today, Mary, Undoer of knots, for You to ask your Son Jesus to grant
    me a pure, divested, humble and trusting heart. I will live today
    practicing these virtues and offering you this as a sign of my love
    for You. I entrust into Your hands this knot (…describe) which keeps
    me from reflecting the glory of God.</p>
    <p>Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me.</p>

    <p>Our Lady Undoer of Knots Meditating Mother, Queen of heaven, in
    whose hands the treasures of the King are found, turn your merciful
    eyes upon me today. I entrust into your holy hands this knot in my
    life…and allthe rancor and resentment it has caused in me. I ask
    Your forgiveness, God the Father, for my sin. Help me now to forgive
    all the persons who consciously or unconsciously provoked this knot.
    Give me, also, the grace to forgive me for having provoked this
    knot. Only in this way can You undo it. Before You, dearest Mother,
    and in the name of Your Son Jesus, my Savior, who has suffered so
    many offenses, having been granted forgiveness, I now forgive these
    persons…and myself, forever. Thank you, Mary, Undoer of Knots for
    undoing the knot of rancor in my heart and the knot which I now
    present to you. Amen.</p>
    <p>Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me.</p>

    <p>Our Lady Undoer of Knots Dearest Holy Mother, you are generous
    with all who seek you, have mercy on me. I entrust into your hands
    this knot which robs the peace of my heart, paralyzes my soul and
    keeps me from going to my Lord and serving Him with my life. Undo
    this knot in my love…., O mother, and ask Jesus to heal my paralytic
    faith which gets down hearted with the stones on the road. Along
    with you, dearest Mother, may I see these stones as friends. Not
    murmuring against them anymore but giving endless thanks for them,
    may I smile trustingly in your power.</p>
    <p>Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me.</p>
    <p>Mary is the Sun and no one is deprived of her warmth.</p>

    <p>Our Lady Undoer of Knots Mother, Undoer of Knots, generous and
    compassionate, I come to You today to once again entrust this
    knot…in my life to you and to ask the divine wisdom to undo, under
    the light of the Holy Spirit, this snarl of problems. No one ever
    saw you angry; to the contrary, your words were so charged with
    sweetness that the Holy Spirit was manifested on your lips. Take
    away from me the bitterness, anger and hatred which this knot has
    caused me. Give me, o dearest Mother, some of the sweetness and
    wisdom that is all silently reflected in your heart. And just as you
    were present at Pentecost, ask Jesus to send me a new presence of
    the Holy Spirit at this moment in my life. Holy Spirit, come upon
    me!</p>
    <p>Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me.</p>
    <p>Mary, with God, is powerful.</p>

    Jesus, in the Eucharist, the Sacrament of Confession; stay with me

    Undoer of Knots, crush the evil one’s head and destroy the traps he
    has set for me by this knot. Thank you, dearest Mother. Most
    Precious Blood of Jesus, free me!</p>

    courage, joyfulness, humility and faith, and, like Elizabeth, to be
    filled with the Holy Spirit. Make me joyfully rest on your bosom,

    can do everything Jesus tells me.</p>

    <p>Our Lady Undoer of Knots Most Holy Mary, our Advocate, Undoer of
    Knots, I come today to thank you for undoing this knot in my
    life…You know very well the suffering it has caused me. Thank you

    to receive once again the divine grace.</p>

    <p>Virgin Mary, Mother of fair love, Mother who never refuses to
    come to the aid of a child in need, Mother whose hands never cease
    to serve your beloved children because they are moved by the divine
    love and immense mercy that exists in your heart, cast your
    compassionate eyes upon me and see the snarl of knots that exist in
    my life.</p>
    <p>You know very well how desperate I am, my pain and how I am bound
    by these knots. Mary, Mother to whom God entrusted the undoing of
    the knots in the lives of His children, I entrust into your hands
    the ribbon of my life.</p>
    <p>No one, not even the evil one himself, can take it away from your
    precious care. In your hands there is no knot that cannot be
    undone.</p>
    <p>Powerful Mother, by your grace and intercessory power with Your
    Son and My Liberator, Jesus, take into your hands today this knot…I
    beg you to undo it for the glory of God, once for all, You are my
    hope.</p>
    <p>O my Lady, you are the only consolation God gives me, the
    fortification of my feeble strength, the enrichment of my
    destitution and with Christ the freedom from my chains. Hear my
    plea.</p>
    <p>Keep me, guide me, protect me, o safe refuge!</p>

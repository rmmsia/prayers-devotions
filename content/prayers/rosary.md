> Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
> crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third
> day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated
> at the right hand of God, the Father almighty. He will come again in
> glory to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit,
> the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of
> sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen."

### The Lord's Prayer
